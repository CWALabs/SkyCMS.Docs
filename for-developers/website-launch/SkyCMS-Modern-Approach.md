# SkyCMS & Modern Approach (Deep Dive)

A practical overview of how SkyCMS facilitates modern website development: modular structure, content workflows, and evergreen quality practices.

## Why This Matters
- Modern sites favor **componentization**, **workflow discipline**, and **continuous quality**.
- SkyCMS’s structure maps to these principles while staying approachable for mixed developer/content teams.

## Core Principles Enabled by SkyCMS

### 1) Componentized Architecture
- **Layouts**: Global scaffolding (header, footer, navigation) — change once, impact site-wide.
- **Templates**: Reusable page-type blueprints (e.g., service, blog) — enforce structure and consistency.
- **Pages**: Content instances — authored by creators using templates.
- Outcome: High reuse, predictable UX, simpler maintenance.

### 2) Content-First Workflows
- Draft → Review → Approve → Publish — reflects contemporary editorial pipelines.
- Roles and permissions support clear responsibilities and safe publishing.
- Training + onboarding materials guide non-technical contributors.

### 3) Separation of Concerns
- Developers own layouts/templates; content creators own pages.
- Minimizes accidental design drift; reduces regression risk.
- Supports parallel work streams (dev vs. content ops).

### 4) Quality Practices Built-In
- Accessibility, performance, SEO, and link validation are treated as first-class concerns.
- Checklists + templates standardize repeatable excellence.
- Maintenance cadence (daily/weekly/monthly) keeps sites healthy post-launch.

### 5) Operational Readiness
- Environment prerequisites and publisher verification steer toward dependable deploys.
- Encourages versioning of templates and controlled rollouts.

## Mapping to Other Stacks
- **Visual Editor** → Any WYSIWYG/block editor (Gutenberg, Sanity Studio, Contentful UI).
- **Templates** → React/Vue/Next components, Razor Pages, or server-side templates.
- **File Manager** → Static assets/CDN (S3 + CloudFront, Azure Blob + CDN).
- **Workflows** → Git-based content flows, editorial review queues, or CI/CD gates.

## Practical Tips
- Keep templates small and focused; avoid monolithic layouts.
- Document content regions clearly; pair each template with examples.
- Track link integrity and image optimization during reviews.
- Schedule the monthly maintenance checklist to catch drift early.

## Where to Start
- Read the [Website Launch Workflow](./Website-Launch-Workflow.md) for the end-to-end roadmap.
- Use the [Training Document Template](../Templates/Training-Document-Template.md) to onboard content creators.
- Adopt the [Content Workflow Template](../Templates/Content-Workflow-Template.md) to codify approvals.

**Applicability**
- These practices are applicable to modern web development broadly; adopt what’s useful and adapt the rest to your stack.
